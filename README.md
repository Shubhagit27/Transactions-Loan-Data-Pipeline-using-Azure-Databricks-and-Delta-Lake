# Transactions-Loan-Data-Pipeline-using-Azure-Databricks-and-Delta-Lake
I built a scalable data pipeline using Azure Databricks and ADLS Gen2. I ingested raw data, cleaned and transformed it into Parquet, and applied SCD Type 1 using Delta Lake MERGE. Data was joined into a master view and stored in the Gold Layer for analytics in Power BI. Auth was handled via Service Principal and Key Vault.
